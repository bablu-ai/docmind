Okay, let's break down and structure the multi-agent system based on your description.
First, I'll provide a consolidated textual description of the system, ensuring all the components and processes you've outlined are included without repetition. Then, I will create the Mermaid architecture diagrams â€“ a simple one followed by a more complex one.
Consolidated System Description
This system is designed to process user queries efficiently using a distributed multi-agent architecture, emphasizing asynchronous operations, scalability, and clear responsibilities.
 * Query Initiation & Tracking:
   * A User submits an initial query.
   * Each query is assigned a Unique Query ID for tracking throughout its lifecycle.
 * Supervision and Task Orchestration:
   * The Supervisor Agent is the central coordinator for incoming queries.
     * It receives the user's query (with its Unique Query ID).
     * It analyzes the query and decomposes it into smaller, manageable tasks.
     * These tasks are then posted to a shared Whiteboard.
 * The Whiteboard (Central Task Hub):
   * Serves as a message bus or task queue.
   * Tasks posted by the Supervisor are available here.
   * Worker Agents pick tasks from the Whiteboard.
   * When a task is picked, it is marked as "In Progress" on the Whiteboard.
   * Worker Agents post their responses/results for completed tasks back to the Whiteboard, associated with the original Unique Query ID and specific task ID.
 * Worker Agent Operations:
   * Multiple Worker Agents concurrently monitor the Whiteboard for available tasks.
   * Task Acquisition Mode:
     * Auto Mode: Agents can autonomously pick tasks from the Whiteboard based on their capabilities or availability.
     * Manual Mode: Agents can be directly assigned tasks by the Supervisor.
   * Processing: Agents execute their assigned tasks.
   * Response Submission: Completed task results are posted back to the Whiteboard.
 * Conflict Resolution:
   * Conflicts can arise if different agents produce contradictory results for the same or related tasks.
   * A conflict resolution mechanism is triggered, which considers:
     * The weight of the agent.
     * The strength of the agent.
     * The reputation of the agent.
   * Crucially, any detected conflict is always marked for Human Intervention, ensuring oversight for ambiguous situations.
 * Response Aggregation and Completeness Check:
   * The Supervisor Agent monitors the Whiteboard for responses related to the tasks of a specific Unique Query ID.
   * It aggregates these individual task responses.
   * The Supervisor then checks the aggregated response for completeness against the original user query.
 * Final Response Processing and Delivery:
   * Once the Supervisor confirms the response is complete, it's passed to a separate Response Agent.
   * The Response Agent applies company policies (e.g., formatting, disclaimers, content guidelines) to the response.
   * The final, policy-compliant response is then delivered to the User.
 * System Scalability and Monitoring:
   * Scalability: Each agent (especially Worker Agents) has the capability to scale up (e.g., by creating more instances) as the load on the system increases, ensuring timely processing.
   * Monitoring: A dedicated mechanism continuously monitors the load on all agents and tracks their availability. This information can be used to manage scaling and ensure system health.
 * Core Operational Principles:
   * Asynchronous Operations: Agents and components interact without strict blocking, allowing for parallel processing and resilience. For example, the Supervisor posts tasks and doesn't have to wait for immediate completion by a specific agent.
   * Unique Identifiers: The consistent use of Unique Query IDs is fundamental for tracking, aggregation, and context management across various asynchronous processes and distributed agents.
Internal Pause & Self-Critique (Description):
 * Is all information from the prompt included? Yes, User, Supervisor, Whiteboard, Worker Agents, Conflict Resolution (with weight, strength, reputation, human intervention), Response Agent, Company Policy, Unique Query ID, Asynchronous, Scalability, Monitoring load/availability, Task states (in progress), Auto/Manual modes for agents, Supervisor checks completeness.
 * Is there any repetition? I've tried to structure it logically to avoid redundancy. For example, the Whiteboard's role is described once as a central hub.
 * Is the flow logical? Yes, from query initiation to final response.
 * Clarity and Conciseness? Seems reasonable.
 * The prompt asked to "Collect all the information in this conversation thread". Since this is the effective start of detailing this system, the "thread" is the current prompt. All points seem covered.
Proceeding to Mermaid diagrams.
Mermaid Architecture Diagrams
Here are the Mermaid diagrams depicting the system.
1. Simple Architecture Diagram
This diagram shows the primary flow of information and control in the system.

    B -- Analyzes & Divides into Tasks --> C{Whiteboard};
    C -- Tasks Available --> D[Worker Agents];
    D -- Pick Task (Marked 'In Progress') --> C;
    D -- Post Response --> C;

Explanation of Simple Diagram:
 * The flow starts with the User Query.
 * The Supervisor Agent processes it and posts tasks to the Whiteboard.
 * Worker Agents pick tasks, process them, and post results back to the Whiteboard.
 * The Supervisor aggregates results and passes them to the Response Agent for policy application.
 * Finally, the response goes back to the User.
Internal Pause & Self-Critique (Simple Diagram):
 * Does it depict the main flow? Yes.
 * Is it simple? Yes, it avoids most of the complexities like conflict resolution, scaling, monitoring explicitly.
 * Is the Mermaid code valid? Yes, it should render correctly.
 * Are colors used as planned (loosely)? Yes, basic coloring is applied.
 * Does it mention Unique Query ID? Yes, at the start.
 * Does it mention 'In Progress'? Yes, in the Worker Agent interaction with the Whiteboard.

Explanation of Complex Diagram:
 * User Interaction: Shows the User submitting a query with a UniqueQueryID.
 * Supervision & Task Management: Details the Supervisor's role in decomposing queries, posting tasks to the Whiteboard, and later checking completeness.
 * Task Execution:
   * Illustrates Worker Agents picking tasks (which are marked 'In Progress').
   * Shows tasks can be picked in 'Auto' or 'Manual' mode.
   * Includes a Scalability subgraph to represent that Worker Agents can scale.
   * Worker Agents post their responses back to the Whiteboard.
 * Conflict Resolution & Human Intervention:
   * If conflicting responses appear on the Whiteboard, the Conflict Resolution Mechanism is invoked.
   * It uses agent metrics (weight, strength, reputation).
   * Crucially, it always flags for Human Intervention. The outcome of human intervention (e.g., reviewed by Supervisor) feeds back into the system, likely by updating tasks or responses on the Whiteboard.
 * Finalization & Delivery: The Response Agent receives the complete response from the Supervisor, applies company policy, and delivers the final response to the User.
 * System Monitoring: The Monitoring System observes the load and availability of all key agents.
 * Colors and Subgraphs: Used to differentiate functional areas and components.
 * Notes: Added to highlight key characteristics like asynchronous communication, scalability, and Unique Query IDs.
 * Connections: Lines indicate the flow of data or control. UniqueQueryID and TaskID are implicitly or explicitly part of these flows.
Internal Pause & Self-Critique (Complex Diagram):
 * Covers all scenarios? It attempts to cover all specified features:
   * User query (Unique QueryID) - Yes
   * Supervisor (analyze, divide, post tasks, check completeness) - Yes
   * Whiteboard (tasks, responses, 'in progress' status) - Yes
   * Worker Agents (pick tasks, post response, auto/manual mode) - Yes
   * Conflict Resolution (weight, strength, reputation, always human intervention) - Yes
   * Response Agent (company policy) - Yes
   * Asynchronous - Mentioned in a note, implied by whiteboard.
   * Scalability - Yes, shown as a subgraph within worker agents.
   * Monitoring (load, availability) - Yes
 * Uses all features of Mermaid (subgraph, colors)? Yes, subgraphs and classDef for colors/styles are used.
 * Differentiates components? Yes, through subgraphs and colors.
 * Is the code valid and complete? The Mermaid code is structured to be valid. I've double-checked syntax.
 * Readability? Complex diagrams can become busy, but the use of subgraphs aims to manage this. The flow should be generally top-to-bottom with some side processes like monitoring and conflict resolution.
 * Human Intervention Feedback Loop: The complex diagram shows Human Intervention, and SA_Intervention (Supervisor Reviews Conflict) feeding back to the Whiteboard. This completes that loop.
I believe the description and both diagrams now capture the requirements you've laid out.
Confidence Level: 95%
 * The system description and diagrams are based directly on the detailed input.
 * The Mermaid syntax is standard; however, rendering can sometimes vary slightly between tools or have limits with extreme complexity. The "complex" diagram is quite detailed, which is good for capturing requirements but can be challenging to render perfectly in all Mermaid environments if it gets too large. The provided one should be manageable.
 * The 5% uncertainty accounts for any minor ambiguities in interpreting the relationships or flow that might be visualized slightly differently by someone else, or limitations in Mermaid for expressing every nuance perfectly without becoming overly cluttered.

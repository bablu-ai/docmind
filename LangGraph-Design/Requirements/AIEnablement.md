    * Facilitating an initial review and refinement of proposals to ensure completeness and alignment before they are forwarded to the budget and senior management approval committee.

**II. AI Framework & Governance**
This involves establishing a consistent, responsible, and high-quality approach to AI development, deployment, and management across the organization.

* **Standardized AI Project Lifecycle & Methodology:**
    * Defining and promoting a tailored AI project lifecycle (e.g., adapting CRISP-DM, Agile for AI) with clear phases, activities, and deliverables.
    * Providing templates for essential project documentation (e.g., project charters, data understanding reports, model documentation, testing plans).
* **AI Best Practices & Development Guidelines:**
    * Developing and disseminating coding standards, software development best practices, and version control guidelines for AI/ML projects.
    * Establishing best practices for data acquisition, data quality assessment, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
    * Creating guidelines for model development, training, hyperparameter tuning, and robust evaluation techniques.
* **Ethical AI & Responsible AI Framework:**
    * Championing and implementing a framework for ethical and responsible AI, covering principles like fairness, transparency, explainability, accountability, privacy, and security.
    * Providing tools and methodologies for conducting bias detection and mitigation in AI models.
    * Offering guidance on data privacy, data anonymization techniques, and security considerations specific to AI systems.
* **Model Validation, Performance Monitoring & MLOps Standards:**
    * Defining a rigorous framework for validating model performance, robustness, and generalizability before deployment.
    * Establishing standards and providing tools for ongoing monitoring of deployed models to detect performance degradation, concept drift, or data drift.
    * Promoting and supporting the adoption of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices for streamlining the end-to-end AI lifecycle.
* **Compliance & Regulatory Adherence Support:**
    * Providing guidance and resources to help project teams understand and adhere to relevant internal policies, industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and legal requirements pertaining to AI and data usage.

**III. AI Enablement & Support**
This pillar focuses on empowering individuals and teams across the organization with the necessary knowledge, skills, and direct assistance to succeed with AI initiatives.

* **Technical Consultation & Expert Advisory:**
